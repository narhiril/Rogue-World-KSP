		SheduInSpaceHigh = Shedu has a strong magnetic field, though not as strong as expected.  It is possible that the metallic conductive layers deep within the planet are relatively thin for some reason.
		SheduInSpaceLow = Shedu's magnetic field funnels charged particles towards the poles, though at this distance from Kerbin, the solar wind is much weaker and so there are no bright, visible aurorae.
		
		ShabririInSpaceHigh = If Shabriri has any sort of magnetic field, it is impossible to distinguish from the subtle fluctuations in Shedu's magnetic field.
		ShabririInSpaceLow = The magnetometer is not getting any significant readings that cannot be attributed to Shedu's magnetic field.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofAbsolution = At this low altitude, it is evident that Shabriri has a very weak magnetic field, suggesting that some of the interior is probably being kept in a liquid state by tidal forces.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofInevitability = There are some weak traces of a magnetic field here.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofRemorse = The magnetometer picks up some faint readings, suggesting some activity deep beneath the surface.
		ShabririSrfLandedCraglands = Magnetic readings here are faint and inconsistent.
		ShabririSrfLandedMidlands = Shabriri seems to have a very weak magnetic field.
		ShabririSrfLandedPolarSnowBanks = This region appears to be very close to one of Shabriri's magnetic poles.
		ShabririSrfLandedSlopes = The faint magnetic field suggests that Shabriri isn't a completely dead world.
		
		LilituInSpaceHigh = If Lilitu has any sort of magnetic field, it is indistinguishable from Shedu's at this altitude.
		LilituInSpaceLow = The magnetometer picks up readings, but none of them can be attributed to the moon below.
		LilituSrfLandedNorthPole = Sensor readings pick up faint magnetic traces at the pole, indicating that tidal forces are at work here.
		LilituSrfLandedSouthPole = Sensor readings pick up faint magnetic traces at the pole.  Without Shedu's tidal forces, this world's core would have cooled long ago.
		LilituSrfLandedMarcobaCrater = This region is a relative hotbed of magnetic activity, though it may just be the remnants of iron meteorites - like the one that made this crater.
		LilituSrfLandedInerCrater = Extremely faint magnetic readings here might be enough to confirm a magnetic field.  Readings would probably be stronger at the poles.
		LilituSrfLandedImpactCraters = This iron meteorite crater has a faint magnetic signature.
		LilituSrfLandedLowlands = The magnetometer picks up some very faint readings which might just be noise.  We should let a professional have a look at them.
		LilituSrfLandedMidlands = It is still difficult, even at the surface, to pick out any local magnetic activity from Shedu's magnetic field readings.
		LilituSrfLandedHighlands = Lilitu's weak magnetic field begins to finally emerge from the background readings.

		SheduInSpaceLowSouthTropicalStorm = The instrument captures some breathtaking images of the gigantic storm.
		SheduInSpaceLow = While not obvious at larger distances, Shedu has some distinct cloud bands.  Different shades of darkness, if you will.
		
		ShabririInSpaceHigh = The instrument gets some good images of Shabriri's bright ice surface.
		ShabririInSpaceLow = While there are plenty of impact craters, none of them seem to be very large or very deep.
		
		LilituInSpaceHigh = The small, dark, cratered moon occupies a space between two of Shedu's dark rings.
		LilituInSpaceLow = Shedu's rings are of very similar color to the surface of the moon, suggesting that the surface is probably covered in ring material.

		SheduInSpaceHigh = The instrument picks up some IR glow from Shedu.

		ShabririInSpaceHigh = Shabriri is highly reflective, on both the IR and visible spectrum.
		ShabririInSpaceHigh = Infrared light from Shedu is bouncing off of Shabriri and onto the sensor.  Shabriri itself seems to be very, very cold and very reflective.

		LilituInSpaceLow = Light passing through Lilitu's thin atmosphere is giving the sensor a wealth of information across multiple spectra.

		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofAbsolution = The nitrogen ice here seems to be very deep.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofInevitability = The ice sheet here is quite deep, according to these readings.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofRemorse = This region is covered by a thick sheet of nitrogen ice.
		ShabririSrfLandedCraglands = The vibrations indicate multiple layers of nitrogen and water ice with rocky material further beneath the surface.  The core even has some activity going on.
		ShabririSrfLandedMidlands = There is a thick layer of water and nitogen ice above a rocky crust.  There are traces of what may be a slush layer containing liquid water, but it is over a mile below the surface.
		ShabririSrfLandedPolarSnowBanks = Beneath the thick snow and ice, the instrument determines that Shabriri has lots of rock.  If it were closer to the warmth of the sun, this might be a very habitable ocean world like Laythe.
		ShabririSrfLandedSlopes = The layers of ice here have been deformed by tidal forces, creating some interesting layering.  It is possible here may even be pockets of liquid water deep below the surface.
		
		LilituSrfLandedNorthPole = The hammer detects a very thick layer of rock almost all the way down to the core - though it also seems to indicate that there may be a small amount of molten material left at the very center.
		LilituSrfLandedSouthPole = Lilitu's small core appears to still be molten - perhaps kept from cooling by tidal forces.
		LilituSrfLandedMarcobaCrater = This cataclysmic impact has even affected rock layers pretty far down below the surface.
		LilituSrfLandedInerCrater = The rock layers here are more dense near the surface - perhaps due to the impact that created this feature.
		LilituSrfLandedImpactCraters = Deep below the crater, faint traces of core activity are detected.
		LilituSrfLandedLowlands = The thick rocky shell around Lilitu's core appears to be thinnest here in the lowlands.
		LilituSrfLandedMidlands = The impact hammer kicks up a lot of dust, but also gets some good measurements.
		LilituSrfLandedHighlands = The sensor's vibrations have to pass through a lot of rock before detecting some faint core activity.

		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofAbsolution = The laser blasts away at the nitrogen ice, gleaning a wealth of information.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofInevitability = Concerns that the laser might reflect back off of the ice and damage the instrument - or something else nearby - prove to be ill-founded.
		ShabririSrfLandedSeaofRemorse = The laser melts a small hole in the nitrogen ice.
		ShabririSrfLandedCraglands = Some silicate materials are mixed in with the ice here.
		ShabririSrfLandedMidlands = Blasting the ice with the laser reveals only more ice.
		ShabririSrfLandedPolarSnowBanks = The laser scan doesn't tell you much more than you already know, but the team back at the KSC will still want to see these readings.
		ShabririSrfLandedSlopes = Collected laser scan data from this region of Shabriri.
		
		LilituSrfLandedNorthPole = Scanning the surface with the laser gives some hint at the composition of Shedu's rings.  The local material a few inches beneath seems to be much lower in iron content.
		LilituSrfLandedSouthPole = While Lilitu's surface appears to consist of ancient basaltic rock, the layers of dust on the surface contain lots of iron and iron oxide.
		LilituSrfLandedMarcobaCrater = Here, the recent impact has blasted away much of the dust from Shedu's rings.  The surface here seems to consist of younger basaltic rock - possibly melted by the energy of the impact.
		LilituSrfLandedInerCrater = The dark reddish iron and iron oxide dust that covers most of Lilitu's surface is thinner here - an earlier layer may have been blown away in the impact that created this crater..  The surface below the dust consists mostly of basaltic rock.
		LilituSrfLandedImpactCraters = The crater site has a high concentration of iron.
		LilituSrfLandedLowlands = The laser beam scans the thick layer of iron and iron oxide dust that has settled here in the lowlands.
		LilituSrfLandedMidlands = The laser instrument excites the neon in the atmosphere, causing a slight orange glow around the beam.
		LilituSrfLandedHighlands = Here in the highlands, the dust covering the rocky surface appears to be a bit thinner.

		LilituSrfLandedImpactCraters = This crater is fairly old, judging by the thick layer of dust covering the surface.
